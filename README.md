***Author @magixx***

​	*Unfortunately, at first time, because of my poor knowledge of action on Linux system, I type in a wrong gcc command, and my DNSClient.c file disappear... I was trying to figure out what can I do to recover my disappeared file. However, it seemed like that there is no room for redemption* :)
​	*Finally, I decided to rewrite them. So this is my second attempt...*
